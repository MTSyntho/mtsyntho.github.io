				<p>Hi! I'm MTSyntho <i>but you can call me 'mt.'</i> :)</p>
				<p>I procrastinate <i>alot</i> however when feeling motivated enough, I can do a variety of things!<br>From building software n games to making <i>hopefully</i> entertatining YouTube videos!</p>

				<h3 class=bold>Software & Game Developement</h3>
				<div class=line></div>
				<p>Since the age of 8 years old, i've always aspired to become a great game developer and now here I am-<br>6 years later (as of Sep 2024) Occasionally making new pieces of software and small games for anyone to use :))</p>
				<p>I've used a variety of tools for development, like Sketchware, Scratch, GDevelop and so on throughout the years however I primarily use Sublime Text (Software Dev) and GDevelop (Game Dev)!<br>I have some links to my works <i>if you're interested</i> :)</p>

				<h3 class=bold>Music Production</h3>
				<div class=line></div>
				<p>Let's be honest, Music is one of the greatest things ever made!<br>Life would honestly be so mundane without it! That's why I make it :)<br>Some of my favourite artists (in order) are: Windows96, stfu.far, AZALI, and the list goes on!</p>
				<p>Anyways, it's best you find my songs on YouTube, however as of Sep 2024,<br>all my <i>much older</i> songs can be found on SoundCloud.</p>

				<h3 class=bold><i>Amateur</i> Artist</h3>
				<div class=line></div>
				<p>For years and years, i've yearned to make digital illustration, but struggled to make progress despite<br>numerous attempts and tutorials. I got back into art after having a friend send me a Demon Slayer fan animation<br> which had apparently been made by a classmate (or schoolmate idk), this reignited my passion for Art!<br>It's pretty fun and the finished result always feels great!</p>
				<p>Anyway, I'm not open for commisions as I still need to practice my skills more and more,<br> but otherwise, you can take a look at my work on ibisPaint n DeviantArt :D</p>

			<div class=content id=youtube>
				<h3 class=bold>YouTuber</h3>
